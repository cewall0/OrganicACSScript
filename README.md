This is a python script that #This program is a script I wrote to enter the raw student score from the 2002 ACS organic chemistry exam. 
The raw score is entered out of 70 points. The program converts that raw score to the national percentile for that student. Then, using the curve
I set up for this exam, finds the final grade (out of 100) that I assign to the student.  If the student takes the exam and gets 0th percentile, they get a 50. The 50th percntile grade gets and 80 on the exam. 100th percentile gets 100.

Additionally, my students take the 1998 ACS organic chemistry exam as seniors for an assessment. I can use this same script to find the percentile ranking for that exam.

I run this from my Mac terminal using Python 3.

In terminal, navigate to the folder/directory where this file is stored. At the prompt, type: python3 organicACSscript.py
